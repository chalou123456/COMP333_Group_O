    "## Description of the task:\n",
    "The objective of Phase 1 of this project is to select a large, real world dataset (>= 1GB). We then do the data retrieval, the wrangling, an EDA with 2 research questions, a baseline model and a report on Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Source of the datasets:\n",
    "The **US Used Cars** dataset is a public dataset available on Kaggle: <br> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the datasets:\n",
    "The **US Used Cars** dataset exceeds the minimum size requirements, has a large number of features, includes real world inconsistencies and supports both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains detailed information about 3 million used cars details across the United States.<br>\n",
    "Each row represents a single vehicle listing, wth each column being an attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The *US Used Cars* dataset contains:**\n",
    "- Vehicle Identification (Vehicle identification number, listing ID)\n",
    "- Vehicle Specifications (Engines, horsepower, fuel, size, legroom, bed, body...)\n",
    "- Market/Dealer Information (city, ZIP, position, days on market, date of listing)\n",
    "- Fuel efficiency\n",
    "- Condition and History (accidents, damages, if it was a cab, if it is new...)\n",
    "- Categorical and Descriptive Features (colours, description, picture...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has a mix of numerical, boolean, high-cardinality categorical and string variables\n",

    "## 1. Data Retrieval: Phase 1 – Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Source\n",
    "We are using the **US Used Cars** public dataset from Kaggle:\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is downloaded as a csv file, and has a size of 9.98 Go\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Retrieval\n",
    "The dataset is retrieved as a **file-based source csv** and is loaded into Python using the pandas function (`read_csv`).\n",
    "We retrieved the data as a CSV file because the data is structured and tabular, it is delivered by Kaggle as a flat file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle provides the dataset as a downloadable csv file. Since the dataset is static, the most reproducible and efficient approach is to store the raw file locally and load it consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Challenge Handling\n",
    "- **Large file size:** Because the Data file is nearly 10 Go, the direct loading can be slow and memory-heavy.\n",
    "  - Mitigation: we use `low_memory=False`. This makes sure the entire file is read before deciding the columns' data type, which leads to less dtypewarning\n",
    "- **Authentication / rate limits:** not applicable because we are not calling an API endpoint in this phase (download is done once via Kaggle).\n",
    "  - If we use Kaggle API later, authentication would require a Kaggle API token. However, for this phase, one static file download was more efficient and safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Raw Data Storage\n",
    "The dataset is stored in the `data/raw/` folder and is treated as read-only."
